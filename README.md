# Eyeblink conditioning labview code for acquisition and extinction
Hardware integration with LabVIEW

The Eyeblinkconditioning protocol is for delay eye blink conditioning. ISI = 250ms. Each session has 100 trials. The first 30 trials are paired stimulation trials with both CS and US. From the 31st trial onwards, 10 CS only trials are randomly included. There are at least one paired trial between two CS only trials. The inter trial interval is randomly changed between 25-35s.

The Eyeblinkconditioning_extinction protocol is for extinction. CS only and US only trials are given alternatively. Each session has 200 trials.
